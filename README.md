##Battle Chess (Chess++)
Battle Chess - aka Chess++ because I prefer that name :) -  is a game that extends the regular chess game and enriches it by adding strategic elements.
The pieces in the game have health points (HP), Attack Points (AP), and special abilities. The players take turns fighting each other's pieces untill one player has no pieces left (Elimination Mode), or until the King is killed (Assassination Mode). 

This game was built by Abdullah Wali and Mert Ege Can as a part of an Object Oriented Software Design course. You can download and try the game from [here](https://github.com/AbdullahWali/Battle-Chess-Game/raw/master/BattleChess.jar)!
